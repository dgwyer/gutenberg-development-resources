# Gutenberg & Block Development Resources

**Please star this repo, and help spread the word!**

Are you looking to level-up your block development or block theme skills? Don't know where to start? You're in the right place!

Below is a list of up-to-date curated resources to help with all things related to editor development. This includes blocks, editor plugins, block-based themes and so on.

This is a new resource and so isn't hugely comprehensive (yet), but it already contains links to some great Gutenberg development content.

**If you have a suggestion then please take a moment to open up a new [pull request](https://github.com/dgwyer/gutenberg-development-resources/pulls), or [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dgwyer/gutenberg-development-resources/issues). Let's grow this list into a valuable resource!**

# Disclaimer

I literally just created this repository and no doubt have missed off some awesome people/resources. I apologise in advance if I've missed anyone during this first pass. But, the idea is that this is an ever growing/changing resource. One which we can all contribute and make it better.
